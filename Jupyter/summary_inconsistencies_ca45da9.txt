Diagnostics of the inconsistencies.txt file:

1/ in the data files that do not end in customFIRA.csv, no data exist about the Tut blocks
--> let's forget about tutorials data -- done

2/ the only reason why the trialIndex column in a data file is not a "pure counter" is because
   of repeated trials, never because of NaNs nor the minimum not being 1
--> checked

3/ for data files ending in _FIRA.csv, in several occasions the data contains blocks not present
   in the metadata. I see no pattern as to which blocks are concerned.

4/ for most "customFIRA" data files, there are blocks reported in the metadata file not appearing
   in the data file. This is worrying as this actually is missing data.

5/ in many data files (both FIRA and customFIRA), the trial count is inconsistent with the 
   metadata file. 
--> currently, output is written whenever none is np.nan nor 0

6/ I just realized that my table_to_print doesn't even contain all the columns from the data!!!
   See 2019_06_24_13_31_FIRA.csv for instance :(

Next step is thus to check the actual sequence of stimulus properties presented in each block
and compare it to the theoretical sequences.
