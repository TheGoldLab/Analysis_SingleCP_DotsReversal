On 09/25/2019 I ran two sessions in the booth (and one session 
was run on 09/23/2019).

The three sessions outputted a *dotsPositions.csv file. 
Just using the "head" Shell function, it looks like the
start of the file in the three sessions is identical.

This is indication that seeding might work across sessions.

I have only analyzed deeply the session from 09/23 and it
is apparent that seeding fails within session (see report
page on altervista.org).


However, following Josh's suggestions, I introduced fprintf
statements every time thisRandStream was called in the
dotsDrawableDotKinetogramDebug class. In the first session
from 09/25, 20 trials were run, but the text output was
too big for the MATLAB console, and only the last 10
trials or so were dumped into the console (I copy-pasted
the content to a log file). In the second session from
09/25, I only ran 5 trials, so that the totallity of the 
MATLAB console could be pasted into the log file.

A quick inspection of the two log files shows similarities
and differences. This is worrying. It looks like from
trial to trial, thisRandStream is not called the exact
same number of times... which disrupts reproducibility.

Are there conditionals that we missed in the code?
i.e. a conditional that depends on the output of rand????
e.g. coinToss ... and the number of coherent dots?
