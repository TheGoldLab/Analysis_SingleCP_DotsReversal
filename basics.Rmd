Note how, for now, this code uses data produced from [this code](https://github.com/aernesto/SingleCP_DotsReversal_Task/releases/tag/pilot1).
```{r}
datafile <- "~/Documents/MATLAB/projects/SingleCP_DotsReversal_Task/data/pilot/pilot1.csv"
data <- read.csv(file=datafile, header=TRUE, sep=",")
str(data)
```
Basic questions that we may, together with their answer:

* How many trials were produced?
```{r}
numTrials <- length(unique(data$trialIndex))
# display warning if somehow a trial or more are duplicated
duplicates <- numTrials != nrow(data)
if (duplicates) {
  print("some trials are duplicated")
} else {
  print(numTrials)
}
```

* How many trials were produced per combination of factors? 
```{r}
# create a smaller dataframe only containing the independent variables
indepVarNames <- c("trialIndex","initDirection","presenceCP","coherence","viewingDuration","probCP","timeCP")
if (duplicates) {
  print("find a way to deal with duplicates!")
} else {
  indVar_df <- data[indepVarNames]
  str(indVar_df)
}

```
```{r}
unique(indVar_df)
```


* What were the marginal frequencies?
```{r}

```
